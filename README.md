# Mini Ruby Projects
This repo is mainly ruby clones of my python projects repo.

# Featured Programs

* Bogo Sort: A really bad sort algorithm that just randomizes an array until it is sorted
* Eight Ball: Just a magic 8 ball
* Fizz Buzz: Prints a response based on if a number is divisible by three, five, both, or neither.
* Hello: Just a hello world
* Word Count: Counts words in a given sentence.

# How to use

I honestly am not an expert on how to run or compile ruby, This repo is just for me to learn how it works. If I had to guess, your best bet is to run it in an IDE like RubyMine or Atom.
